<p>This document is a quick summary of the distribution of nitrate data collected by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County. Source data are available <a href="https://epcbocc.sharepoint.com/sites/Share/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FShare%2FShared%20Documents%2FOutbound%2FERM%2FWQM%5FReports&amp;p=true&amp;ga=1" target="_blank">here</a>. Nitrates and nitrites have been collectively measured since the early 1980s, with only nitrate quantified prior.</p>
